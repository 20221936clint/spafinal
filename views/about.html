        <h1>Hello, I'm Ertito Clint Mark D. Alaba</h1>
        <p>I'm a dedicated student. I have a strong passion for information technology and have been involved in several projects. Here is a brief introduction about myself:</p>
        <p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Information Technology at Northern Bukidnon State College (NBSC). Before that, I completed my final term of project in your subject in Web System (Elective).</p>
        <p>I am skilled in web developing. In my free time, I like to explore new places and cultures.</p>
